- Best Practices -- Create an Admin IAM Group (AdministratorAccess) to replace root user for day-to-day activities
- IAM Password Policy - behave bitch (cycle passwords)
- MFA
  - Virtual MFA device
  - U2F Security Key
  - Hardware Key Fob MFA Device
  - Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud
- 3 Ways to Access AWS:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS CLI

- IAM Roles used to assign permission to AWS Services
- IAM Credentials Report
  - account-level, list all account users and credential status
- IAM Access Advisor
  - user-level, shows service permissions on user and when last used (least-privilege)

### Section 04: EC2 Fundamentals

- AWS Budget - create alarms triggered when budget threshold metrics are exceeded
- EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distribute load using (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using auto-scaling group (ASG)
- EC2 User Data
  - Script used to bootstrap EC2 instance, only run once, first start
  - Used to automate boot tasks:
    - Installing updates
    - Installing software
    - Downloading common files from internet
    - Anything really
  - Runs as root user
- Security Group
  - set of firewall rules that control traffic for your instance
  - work on instance-level
  - contain only `allow` rules
  - Can reference by `IP` or by `Security Group`
  - SG regulate:
    - Access to Ports
    - Authorized IP ranges (IPv4 & IPv6)
    - Control `inbound` traffic to instance
    - Control `outbound` traffic from instance to "other"s
      - By default
        - `all outbound traffic is allowed`
        - `all inbound traffic is blocked`
  - Can be attached to multiple instances
  - Locked to Region/VPC combination
  - Request is intercepted before EC2 instance receives it
  - "time out" -> request not allowed by SG
  - "connection refused" -> application issue
- Classic PORTS to know
  - `22` -> SSH
  - `21` -> FTP
  - `22` -> SFTP
  - `80` -> HTTP
  - `442` -> HTTPS
  - `3389` -> RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
- Instance Types (7)
  - General Purpose
  - Compute Optimized
  - Memory Optimized
  - Accelerated Computing
  - Storage Optimized
  - Instance Features
  - Measuring Instance Performance
- SSH
  - `ssh -i KEY.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP`

  - Attach IAM Roles to EC2 Instances
    - `DON'T RUN "aws configure" within an instance terminal!!!`
- EC2 instances Purchasing Options
  - On-Demand
    - short-term, un-interrupted workloads
  - Reserved (1 & 3 years)
    - Reserved Instances (long workloads)
      - `Instance Type`, `Region`, `Tenancy`, `OS`
      - `Reserved Instance Scope` - `Regional` or `Zonal`
    - Convertible Reserved Instances - (long workloads with flexible instances)
      - Can change specs
  - Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) - commitments to an amount of usage, long workload
    - Commit to dollar/hour for 1 & 3 years
    - Locked to `instance family` and `region`
  - Spot Instances - short workload, cheap, can be interrupted
    - Jobs that are resilient to failure:
      - Batch jobs
      - Data analysis
      - Image processing
      - Distributed workloads
    - `max spot price`, `2 minutes`
  - Dedicated Host - book physical host
    - `compliance requirements`, `server-bound software licenses`
  - Dedicated Instances - No other customer will share your hardware
    - No control over placement of hardware
  - Capacity Reservations - Reserve capacity in specific AZ for any duration
    - Reserve On-Demand in a specific AZ
    - No time commitment, no billing discount
    - Charge whether you use it or not
    - `short-term`, `uninterrupted workloads` in a `specific AZ`
- Spot Fleet
  - `lowest price` - cost optimization, short workloads
  - `diversified` - great for availability, long workloads
  - `capacityOptimized` - optimal capacity

### Section 05: EC2 Solutions Architect Level

- Elastic IP
  - a Public IP (IPv4) that can be attached to an instance to retain a fixed IP address
  - limited to 5 Elastic IP
  - not a good architecture pattern
  - in theory, it allows for a failed instance to be remapped as a disaster recovery strategy
  - ELB is a better approach
- EC2 Placement Groups
  - Cluster - low-latency group in single AZ
    - 10 Gbps network, low-latency, same rack, same AZ, high risk
  - Spread - max 7 instances/group/AZ - critical applications
    - minimize failure risk (all instances on different hardware)
    - span multiple AZ
    - maximize high availability
  - Partition - 100s EC2 instances/group (allows Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra)
    - Up to 7 partitions per AZ
    - Multiple AZs in same Region
    - 100s of EC2 instances
    - Partitions on separate racks
    - Big Data Applications (HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka)
- Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
  - Virtual Network Card

- EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume
  - network drive - can persist data after termination
  - `multi-attached` to mount EBS onto multiple EC2 instances
  - bound to specific AZ
- EBS snapshots
  - backup of EBS volume
  - can copy snapshots onto other AZ/Regions
- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - 24 - 72 hours to restore, 75% cheaper
- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  - To recover EBS Snapshots after accidental deletion
  - 1 day to 1 year
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  - expensive but quick; useful for big volumes
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
  - customization of an EC2 instance
  - allows for faster boot (pre-packaged software packages/setup)
  - Can come from three sources:
    - Public AMI
    - Custom AMI (you maintain it)
    - AWS Marketplace AMI
- EC2 Instance Store
  - High-performance hardware disk
  - Storage is ephemeral
  - buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
  - backups and replication are your responsibility

    - io2 Block Express - sub-millisecond latency; MAX IOPS 256,000 IOPS:GB 1,000,1
    - `supports EBS multi-attach`!!!
  - `st1 (HDD)` - Low cost volume, frequent access and high throughput
    - Max throughput 500 MiB/s to 500
  - `sc1 (HDD)` - Low cost, less frequent access
  - For `gp3`, IOPS and volume are independent; `gp2` 3 IOPS per GB - linked
- EBS Multi-Attach (`io1/io2 family`)
  - Attach multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
  - Up to 16 EC2 instances at a time
  - Must use a File System that is cluster-aware

    - `Server-Side Encryption (SSE)`
      - `Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)`
        - keys handled, managed, and owned by AWS
        - Encrypted with `AES-256`
        - Must set Header: `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256`
        - Enabled by default for new buckets and new objects
      - `Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)`
        - Leverage AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage encryption keys
        - Advantages: user control + audit key usage using CloudTrail
        - Header: `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms`
        - Upload => `GenerateDataKey` KMS API
        - Download => `Decrypt` KMS API
        - There is a quota on requests. Service Quotas Console to request increase
      - `Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)`
        - When you want to manage your own encryption keys
        - S3 does NOT store key; key must be uploaded with HTTP headers using HTTPS
    - `Client-Side Encryption`
      - User responsible for encrypting data before sending
        - Can use: `Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library`
        - Bucket Policies are handled before DEFAULT ENCRYPTION!!!
- `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)`
  - `Origin = scheme + host + port`
  - By default, Web Browsers deny cross-origin requests
  - Destination but allow requests, CORS HEADERS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- `Amazon S3 - MFA Delete`
  - Required: Permanently delete an object, or disable Versioning. Only bucket owner and root account can disable MFA delete
  - `aws configure --profile NAME-OF-PROFILE`
  - `aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket NAME-OF-BUCKET --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "ARN-OF-MFA-DEVICE MFA-CODE" --profile NAME-OF-PROFILE`
- `S3 Access Logs`
  - Can be analyzed using Amazon Athena
  - DO NOT set logging bucket to same as monitoring bucket!!!
    - Leads to a logging loop!!!
- `S3 Pre-Signed URLs`
  - URL Expiration (1min to 720 min in Console; 7 days max in AWS CLI/SDK)
- `S3 Glacier Vault Lock`
  - it's like a bucket where you can delete shit (WORM - Write Once Read Many)
  - Vault Lock Policy
  - Helpful for compliance
- `S3 Object Lock` - must enable versioning; blocks version deletion
  - Retention Modes
    - `Compliance` => no one can delete shit
    - `Governance` => admins/root can delete shit
  - Retention Period - Protect object for a fixed amount of time; can be extended
  - `Legal Hold`
    - _s3:PutObjectLegalHold_ IAM Permission
    - protect object indefinitely; independent from retention period
- `S3 Access Points`

  - low latency (<10ms)
  - 256KB message limit
  - **At least once delivery**, _"best effort ordering"_ by default
    - `SendMessage` API, message persisted until Consumer deletes message
  - unlimited throughput (in standard configuration)
  - Polling up to `10 messages at a time`. `DeleteMessage` API, `ReceiveMessages`
  - Scale Consumers using ASG and `CloudWatch Metric` (`ApproximateNumberOfMessages`) -> setup a `CloudWatch Alarm`
  - Security:
    - in-flight with HTTPS API, at rest with KMS keys, or client-side encryption
    - Access Controls via IAM policies or SQS Access Policies (cross-account)
  - Messages become `invisible` to other consumers once polled - set _message visibility timeout_ - default 30 seconds --- must be processed and deleted by Consumer or message will return to the queue
    - `ChangeMessageVisibility` API can give a Consumer more time to process
- `SNS - Simple Notification Service` - Pub/Sub model
  - pub/sub model
- `Kinesis` - Real-Time Streaming mode
