## Notes

### Section 01: Introduction

- No notes

### Section 02: Getting Started with AWS

- AWS is the biggest Cloud Provider
- AWS Regions
  - cluster of data centers
  - Most AWS Services are region-scoped
- How to select an AWS Region
  - Compliance
  - Proximity
  - Available services
  - Pricing
- AWS Availability Zones
  - Minimum of 2 AZ within each AWS Region (usually 3)
  - Discrete data centers, redundant power, networking, and connectivity
  - Ultra-low latency networking
- AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
  - 216+ PoP

### Section 03: IAM

- IAM Groups only contain IAM Users
- IAM Policy ... JSON document
  - Define permission for users
  - Least Privilege
- Best Practices -- Create an Admin IAM Group (AdministratorAccess) to replace root user for day-to-day activities
- IAM Password Policy - behave bitch (cycle passwords)
- MFA
  - Virtual MFA device
  - U2F Security Key
  - Hardware Key Fob MFA Device
  - Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud
- 3 Ways to Access AWS:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS CLI
  - AWS SDK
- IAM Roles used to assign permission to AWS Services
- IAM Credentials Report
  - account-level, list all account users and credential status
- IAM Access Advisor
  - user-level, shows service permissions on user and when last used (least-privilege)

### Section 04: EC2 Fundamentals

- AWS Budget - create alarms triggered when budget threshold metrics are exceeded
- EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distribute load using (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using auto-scaling group (ASG)
- EC2 User Data
  - Script used to bootstrap EC2 instance, only run once, first start
  - Used to automate boot tasks:
    - Installing updates
    - Installing software
    - Downloading common files from internet
    - Anything really
  - Runs as root user
- Security Group
  - set of firewall rules that control traffic for your instance
  - work on instance-level
  - contain only `allow` rules
  - Can reference by `IP` or by `Security Group`
  - SG regulate:
    - Access to Ports
    - Authorized IP ranges (IPv4 & IPv6)
    - Control `inbound` traffic to instance
    - Control `outbound` traffic from instance to "other"s
      - By default
        - `all outbound traffic is allowed`
        - `all inbound traffic is blocked`
  - Can be attached to multiple instances
  - Locked to Region/VPC combination
  - Request is intercepted before EC2 instance receives it
  - "time out" -> request not allowed by SG
  - "connection refused" -> application issue
- Classic PORTS to know
  - `22` -> SSH
  - `21` -> FTP
  - `22` -> SFTP
  - `80` -> HTTP
  - `442` -> HTTPS
  - `3389` -> RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
- Instance Types (7)
  - General Purpose
  - Compute Optimized
  - Memory Optimized
  - Accelerated Computing
  - Storage Optimized
  - Instance Features
  - Measuring Instance Performance
- SSH
  - `ssh -i KEY.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP`
  - `chmod 0400 KEY.pem`
- EC2 Instance Connect
  - Browser-based terminal to connect to EC2 Instance via AWS Management Console
  - Attach IAM Roles to EC2 Instances
    - `DON'T RUN "aws configure" within an instance terminal!!!`
- EC2 instances Purchasing Options
  - On-Demand
    - short-term, un-interrupted workloads
  - Reserved (1 & 3 years)
    - Reserved Instances (long workloads)
      - `Instance Type`, `Region`, `Tenancy`, `OS`
      - `Reserved Instance Scope` - `Regional` or `Zonal`
    - Convertible Reserved Instances - (long workloads with flexible instances)
      - Can change specs
  - Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) - commitments to an amount of usage, long workload
    - Commit to dollar/hour for 1 & 3 years
    - Locked to `instance family` and `region`
  - Spot Instances - short workload, cheap, can be interrupted
    - Jobs that are resilient to failure:
      - Batch jobs
      - Data analysis
      - Image processing
      - Distributed workloads
    - `max spot price`, `2 minutes`
  - Dedicated Host - book physical host
    - `compliance requirements`, `server-bound software licenses`
  - Dedicated Instances - No other customer will share your hardware
    - No control over placement of hardware
  - Capacity Reservations - Reserve capacity in specific AZ for any duration
    - Reserve On-Demand in a specific AZ
    - No time commitment, no billing discount
    - Charge whether you use it or not
    - `short-term`, `uninterrupted workloads` in a `specific AZ`
- Spot Fleet
  - `lowest price` - cost optimization, short workloads
  - `diversified` - great for availability, long workloads
  - `capacityOptimized` - optimal capacity

### Section 05: EC2 Solutions Architect Level

- Elastic IP
  - a Public IP (IPv4) that can be attached to an instance to retain a fixed IP address
  - limited to 5 Elastic IP
  - not a good architecture pattern
  - in theory, it allows for a failed instance to be remapped as a disaster recovery strategy
  - ELB is a better approach
- EC2 Placement Groups
  - Cluster - low-latency group in single AZ
    - 10 Gbps network, low-latency, same rack, same AZ, high risk
  - Spread - max 7 instances/group/AZ - critical applications
    - minimize failure risk (all instances on different hardware)
    - span multiple AZ
    - maximize high availability
  - Partition - 100s EC2 instances/group (allows Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra)
    - Up to 7 partitions per AZ
    - Multiple AZs in same Region
    - 100s of EC2 instances
    - Partitions on separate racks
    - Big Data Applications (HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka)
- Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
  - Virtual Network Card
  - Can have:
    - 1 Primary (eth0) private IPv4, one or more secondary (eth1) IPv4
    - 1 Public IPv4
    - 1 Elastic IP/private-IPv4
    - 1 or more SG
    - MAC address
  - Bound to a specific AZ
  - Create ENI independently of EC2 instance and attachable on the fly (use case failover)
- EC2 Hibernate
  - Stop, Terminate, Hibernate
  - EBS root volume must be incremented and EBS volume > RAM size; 60 day limit

### Section 06: EC2 Instance Storage

- EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume
  - network drive - can persist data after termination
  - `multi-attached` to mount EBS onto multiple EC2 instances
  - bound to specific AZ
- EBS snapshots
  - backup of EBS volume
  - can copy snapshots onto other AZ/Regions
- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - 24 - 72 hours to restore, 75% cheaper
- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  - To recover EBS Snapshots after accidental deletion
  - 1 day to 1 year
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  - expensive but quick; useful for big volumes
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
  - customization of an EC2 instance
  - allows for faster boot (pre-packaged software packages/setup)
  - Can come from three sources:
    - Public AMI
    - Custom AMI (you maintain it)
    - AWS Marketplace AMI
- EC2 Instance Store
  - High-performance hardware disk
  - Storage is ephemeral
  - buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
  - backups and replication are your responsibility
- EBS Volume Types (6 Types)
