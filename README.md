- IAM Roles used to assign permission to AWS Services
- IAM Credentials Report
  - account-level, list all account users and credential status
- IAM Access Advisor
  - user-level, shows service permissions on user and when last used (least-privilege)

### Section 04: EC2 Fundamentals

- AWS Budget - create alarms triggered when budget threshold metrics are exceeded
- EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distribute load using (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using auto-scaling group (ASG)
- EC2 User Data
  - Script used to bootstrap EC2 instance, only run once, first start
  - Used to automate boot tasks:
    - Installing updates
    - Installing software
    - Downloading common files from internet
    - Anything really
  - Runs as root user
- Security Group
  - set of firewall rules that control traffic for your instance
  - work on instance-level
  - contain only `allow` rules
  - Can reference by `IP` or by `Security Group`
  - SG regulate:
    - Access to Ports
    - Authorized IP ranges (IPv4 & IPv6)
    - Control `inbound` traffic to instance
    - Control `outbound` traffic from instance to "other"s
      - By default
        - `all outbound traffic is allowed`
        - `all inbound traffic is blocked`
  - Can be attached to multiple instances
  - Locked to Region/VPC combination
  - Request is intercepted before EC2 instance receives it
  - "time out" -> request not allowed by SG
  - "connection refused" -> application issue
- Classic PORTS to know
  - `22` -> SSH
  - `21` -> FTP
  - `22` -> SFTP
  - `80` -> HTTP
  - `442` -> HTTPS
  - `3389` -> RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
- Instance Types (7)
  - General Purpose

  - Reserved (1 & 3 years)
    - Reserved Instances (long workloads)
      - `Instance Type`, `Region`, `Tenancy`, `OS`
      - `Reserved Instance Scope` - `Regional` or `Zonal`
    - Convertible Reserved Instances - (long workloads with flexible instances)
      - Can change specs
  - Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) - commitments to an amount of usage, long workload
    - Commit to dollar/hour for 1 & 3 years
    - Locked to `instance family` and `region`
  - Spot Instances - short workload, cheap, can be interrupted
    - Jobs that are resilient to failure:
      - Batch jobs
      - Data analysis
      - Image processing
      - Distributed workloads
    - `max spot price`, `2 minutes`
  - Dedicated Host - book physical host

  - `diversified` - great for availability, long workloads
  - `capacityOptimized` - optimal capacity

### Section 05: EC2 Solutions Architect Level

- Elastic IP
  - a Public IP (IPv4) that can be attached to an instance to retain a fixed IP address
  - limited to 5 Elastic IP
  - not a good architecture pattern
  - in theory, it allows for a failed instance to be remapped as a disaster recovery strategy
  - ELB is a better approach
- EC2 Placement Groups
  - Cluster - low-latency group in single AZ
    - 10 Gbps network, low-latency, same rack, same AZ, high risk
  - Spread - max 7 instances/group/AZ - critical applications
    - minimize failure risk (all instances on different hardware)
    - span multiple AZ
    - maximize high availability
  - Partition - 100s EC2 instances/group (allows Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra)
    - Up to 7 partitions per AZ
    - Multiple AZs in same Region
    - 100s of EC2 instances
    - Partitions on separate racks

  - can copy snapshots onto other AZ/Regions
- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - 24 - 72 hours to restore, 75% cheaper
- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
  - To recover EBS Snapshots after accidental deletion
  - 1 day to 1 year
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  - expensive but quick; useful for big volumes
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
  - customization of an EC2 instance
  - allows for faster boot (pre-packaged software packages/setup)
  - Can come from three sources:
    - Public AMI
    - Custom AMI (you maintain it)
    - AWS Marketplace AMI
- EC2 Instance Store
  - High-performance hardware disk

  - `st1 (HDD)` - Low cost volume, frequent access and high throughput
    - Max throughput 500 MiB/s to 500
  - `sc1 (HDD)` - Low cost, less frequent access
  - For `gp3`, IOPS and volume are independent; `gp2` 3 IOPS per GB - linked
- EBS Multi-Attach (`io1/io2 family`)
  - Attach multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
  - Up to 16 EC2 instances at a time

    - 50 cents/month per Hosted Zone
  - `TTL` = Time To Live (60 sec to 24 hours) (Mandatory except for Alias Records)
  - `Alias` record can point to SLD and comes with built-in health check
    - Maps a hostname to an AWS Resource
    - Automatically recognizes changes to resource's IP address
    - Can point to Zone Apex
    - Always of type A/AAAA
    - Can't set TTL
    - Targets:
      - ELB, CloudFront Distributions, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk, S3 Websites, VPC InE, Global Accelerator, Route 53 records in same HZ
      - _CAN NOT set an ALIAS for an EC2 DNS name_
  - Routing Policies
    - Simple (no health checks)
    - Weighted
      - DNS records must have same name and type
    - Failover
    - Latency based
    - Geolocation
    - Geoproximity (Route 53 Traffic Flow feature)
    - Multi-Value Answer
  - `Health Checks`
    - _only_ for Public Resources
    - Three Types:
      - Health Checks that monitor an endpoint
      - Calculated Health Checks
      - Health Check that monitor a CloudWatch Alarm (can be used to monitor private resources)
    - Integrated with CW metrics

    - Session Affinity (ELB Setting)
    - Browser Cookies (User)
      - stateless
      - Heaving HTTP requests
      - Security Risk (cookies are mutable)
      - Must validate cookies, 4KB limit
    - ElastiCache - sub-millisecond (via sessionId) or DynamoDB
  - Scale reads with RDS RR (up to 5) or implement `write-through` via ElastiCache (cache validation)
  - Multi-AZ for Disaster Recovery
  - Example of 3-Tier Architecture
